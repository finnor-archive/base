Hello:

There are three series of input files; all are correct

The input series (series1, series2, series3) are sets of related runs, created from each other using the working software
which is now missing, and you need to fix.

For instance, in series3/

board_W1.txt  ---- generation 1
board_W2.txt  ---- generation 2
board_W3.txt  ---- generation 3
board_W4.txt  ---- generation 4
board_W10.txt ---- generation 10

This in particular is helpful in finding errors because it has symmetry.

These files are correct! They need to be able to be read and written by the application program.
