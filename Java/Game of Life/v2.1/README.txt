The Java programs here contain bugs.

The working class forms of the files do not contain these bugs, for reference.

Once you have debugged the Java programs, you will be able to verify and compare the output
to the working versions.

Be aware that the test drivers themselves do not contain bugs, they are know good test drivers,
and when you use the prebuilt class files, they work correctly.

The problem is that we don't have the correct source to go with these class files, and so 
we have to debug it.
