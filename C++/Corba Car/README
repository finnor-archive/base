The Smart Car project includes two shell scripts to assist in starting
the processes: the 'start_naming_service' and 'run' scripts. The
'start_naming_service' starts the naming service. The 'run' script can
start any of the Smart Car processes, depending on which argument is
given at the command line. It is preferable to start each process in a
separate terminal window, so that the output of each process in seen
clearly.

Execution instructions:

1. In a terminal, start the naming service by running the
   'start_naming_service' script:

    %> ./start_naming service
    
2. In a second terminal, start the Dashboard server using the 'run'
   script:

    %> ./run dashboard
    
3. In a third terminal, start the Tire server using the 'run' script:

    %> ./run tire
    
4. In a fourth terminal, start the Sensor client using the 'run'
   script:

    %> ./run sensor
    
5. In a fifth terminal, start the Brakes server using the 'run' script:

    %> ./run brakes
    
6. The Brakes client will prompt for a brake amount to be entered.
   Enter a brake amount. After processing the input, the Brake client
   will prompt for input again.

7. Kill all of the processes to shut down the Smart Car system.


Build instructions:

1. In a terminal, run the 'configure_smart_car' script to set up the
   environment:

    %> ./configure_smart_car
    
2. Run 'make':

    %> make
